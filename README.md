Summarizing Selected Survey Papers Concerning Medical Image Processing
==============================
This is a **preliminary study** for the master's **thesis**.

It contains markdown files that summarize a set of selected recent literature reviews that mainly discuss the
implications of image processing and deep learning in the medical field.

> **NOTE:** The summarization is liable to errors and incomplete information. It does not substitute any of the
> mentioned papers; nor completes it.
