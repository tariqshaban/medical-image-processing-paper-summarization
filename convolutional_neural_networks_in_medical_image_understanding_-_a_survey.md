  anatomy or functioning
* Medical image capturing devices:

* Involves the extraction of features from the image, and assigning labels using the extracted features

### Medical image segmentation

* Helps in:
    * Image understanding
    * Feature extraction and recognition
    * Quantitative assessment of lesions or other abnormalities
* The objective of segmentation is to divide an image into regions that have strong correlations

### Medical image localization

* An important step towards automatic acquisition planning and post imaging analysis tasks
* Involves predicting the object in an image, drawing a bounding box around the object and labeling the object

### Medical image detection

  regions of interest and labeling them

Medical image understanding
------------

* Eyes capture the image, which is processed by the neurons and sent to the brain for interpretation
* Such process is complex for machines
* CNN is a deep learning algorithm inspired by the visual cortex of animal brain and aims to imitate the visual
  machinery of animals
* CNNs are made of convolutions having learnable weights and biases similar to neurons (nerve cells) of the animal

> ![core_building_blocks_of_cnn.png](assets/images/convolutional_neural_networks_in_medical_image_understanding_-_a_survey/core_building_blocks_of_cnn.png)

### Convolution layers (Conv layers)

* The visual cortex of the animal brain is made of neuronal cells which extract features of the images
* Each neuronal cell extracts different features, which help in image understanding
* The conv layer is modeled over the neuronal cells and its objective is to extract features, such as:
    * Edges
    * Colors
    * Texture
    * Gradient orientation
* Conv layers are made of learnable filters called convolutional filters (kernels)
* During the forward pass, the kernels are convolved across the width and height of input volume and dot product is
  computed between the entries of the filter and the input.
* The CNN learns filters that gets activated when they come across edge, colors, texture etc.
* The output of the conv layer is fed into an activation function layer

### Activation functions or nonlinear functions

* Used for nonlinear transformation of the data
* Ensures that the representation in the input space is mapped to a different output space as per the requirements
* Common activation functions:
    * Sigmoid: takes a real-valued number x and squashes it into range between 0 and 1
    * Tan hyperbolic: takes a real valued number x and squashes it between âˆ’1 to 1
    * Rectified linear unit (ReLU): takes a real valued number x and converts x to 0 if x is negative (Most often used
      nonlinear function for CNN, since it has a relatively low computation time)

### Pooling

* Performs nonlinear down sampling of convolved feature
* Decreases the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction
* Reduces the spatial size by aggregating data over space or feature type
* Controls overtiring and overcomes translation and rotational variance of images
* Partitions the input into a set of rectangle patches, each patch gets replaced by a single value depending on the type
  of pooling selected

### Fully connected (FC) layer

* Similar to artificial neural network, where each node has incoming connections from all the inputs and all the
  connections have weights associated with them
* The output is sum of all the inputs multiplied by the corresponding weights.
* FC layer is followed by sigmoid activation function and performs the classifier job

### Data preprocessing and augmentation

* Raw images obtained from imaging modalities need to be preprocessed and augmented before sending to CNN
* Raw image data might be:
    * Skewed
    * Altered by bias distortion
    * Have intensity inhomogeneity during capture
* CNN needs to be trained on a larger dataset to achieve the best performance
* Data augmentation increases the existing set of images by:
    * Horizontal and vertical flips
    * Transformations
    * Scaling
    * Random cropping
    * Color jittering
    * Intensity variations

### CNN architectures and frameworks

* CNN frameworks (toolkits) enable the efficient development and implementation of deep learning methods
* Various award-winning CNN architectures:
    * LeNet-5
    * AlexNet
    * Overfeat
    * ZFNet
    * VGGNet
    * GoogLeNet
    * ResNet
    * Xception

Critical review and conclusion
------------

* CNNs have been successfully applied in the areas of medical image understanding
* This section provides a critical review of applications of CNNs in medical image understanding
* Hyperparameters optimization (dropout rate, learning rate, optimizer etc.) help in enhancing or declining the
  performance of a network
* CNNs require exhaustive amounts of data containing the most comprehensive information during training
* Insufficient information or features leads to underftting of the model, solution: augmentation
* Transfer learning and fne-tuning could also be used to enhance the efficiency in case of sparse availability of data
* Small-sized kernels could be used to enhance the performance by capturing low-level textual information. However, it
  is at the cost of increased computational complexity during training
* Multiple pathway architecture could be used to enhance performance of CNN (increases the computational burden on the
  processor and memory)
* One of the challenge involved in medical data is the class imbalance problem
* Designing CNNs to work on imbalanced data is a challenging task, solution: applying augmentation of the
  under-represented data
* Denser CNNs could also lead to the vanishing gradient problem, solution: use skip connections as in the inceptionNet
  architecture
* CNNs would be more efficient if the data consists of not only images, but also patient history

Conclusion
------------

* The heterogeneous nature of medical anomalies in terms of shape, size, appearance, location and symptoms poses
  challenges for medical anomaly diagnosis and prognosis
* ML-based healthcare systems need efficient feature extraction methods. But efficient features are still unknown or
  inefficient
* CNN is a popular technique for solving medical image understanding challenges due to its highly efficient methods of
  feature extraction and learning low-level, mid-level and high-level discriminant features of an input medical image
* The CNN methods discussed in this paper have been found to either outperform or compliment the existing traditional
  and ML approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, AUC. However, their performance is often not the best due to a
  few factors
* CNN models have been described as black boxes and there is a lot of research happening in terms of analyzing and
  understanding output at every layer
* Researchers are also working on image captioning (textual representations of the image); enable physicians to
  understand the perception of the network at both output layer and intermediate levels
